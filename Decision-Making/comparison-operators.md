# Comparison Operators

We use comparison operators inorder to compare values.

They return boolean values. ie- either `True` or `False`
* `==` &rarr; Checks if both values are **equal** to each other.
* `!=` &rarr; Checks if both values are **not equal** to each other.
* `>`  &nbsp; &rarr; Checks if the value on the left is **greater** than the value on the right. 
* `>=` &rarr; Returns true if the value is **greater** than and **equal** to the value on the right.
* `<` &rarr; Checks if the value on the left is **smaller** than the value on the right. 
* `<=` &rarr; Returns true if the value is **smaller** than and **equal** to the value on the right.



```
print(4 == (2 * 2))            
print("Hello!" == "Hi!")       

print(2 != 4)
print("Asif" != "Shrikanth")

print(96 > 96)
print(96 >= 96)

print(45 < 78)
print(55 <= 4)
