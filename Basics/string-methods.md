# String methods

* The `+` operator is used to **concatenate** two strings together
```python
print("Hello" + " " + "World!")
```
* The `*` operator is used to **repeat** the string a certain amount of times
```python
print("Ha"*2)
```
* `str()` is used to _typecast_ integer or floating point numbers to strings
```python
print(str(22))
```
