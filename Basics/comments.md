# Comments

* A comment is created by a `#` followed by a text.
* During execution, comments are ignored and are not executed.
* They basically make the code more readable.
* A multi-line comment should have a # in front of every line
    * You also can create a multi-line comment using three quotation marks. 
    * But, keep in mind that this technique doesn’t create “true” comments. This simply inserts a text constant that doesn’t do anything.
* A comment can also be used to comment out the code you don't want to execute.
